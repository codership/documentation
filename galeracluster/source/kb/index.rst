   Article Counts: 10 Troubleshooting, 13 Best Practices; Recent Changes: 6 Revised, 2 New Articles

:doc:`The Codership Documentation <../documentation/index>` explains in detail how to deploy and administer a Galera Cluster. This section, the Codership Knowledge Base (KB) contains information on resolving problems and improving use of Galera Cluster.  Here you'll find troubleshooting articles and best practices articles.

In essence, the Documentation is how to use Galera assuming everything goes according to plan; the KB is for when things don't go as expected or when they could be better.

In addition to this KB, you can also post questions on the `Codership Forum <https://galeracluster.com/community/>`_. The community, as well as our staff monitor and respond to posts made there. If you need more immediate and personalized assistance, you can get a Support contract with us at Codership.

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 518 words; Pub: Apr 2014; Revised: Sep 2019

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Changes to the ``mysql`` database (e.g., user name, host address) are not replicated on other nodes. This can cause problems for users, as well as frustrate the DBA.

   .. rubric:: :doc:`auto-increment-multiples`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 995 words; Pub: Oct 2019

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Key columns using ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` will increase values by more than one with Galera. This can be confusing and worrisome, but this article explains why this is a good method.

   .. rst-class:: section-heading
   .. rubric:: Performance


.. container:: list-col1

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Group Commit <group-commit>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 322 words; Pub: May 2019; Revised: Oct 2019

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      When several transactions try to commit simultaneously, ``GROUP COMMIT`` flushes them to the disk with a single system call, rather than a call for each, greatly improving performance.


   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Large Transactions <large-transactions>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 443 words; Pub: Apr 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Large transactions can lead to diminished performance. One reason for this is that the table may be reindexing and rescanning after each row is deleted.


   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Parallel Applier Threads <parallel-applier-threads>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 366 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Parallel threads don't ensure better performance, but they don't impair performance and they may actually increase synchronization of new nodes joining a cluster.


   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Slow Nodes <detecting-slow-node>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

   Length: 297 words; Pub: Apr 2014

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      By design, cluster performance won't be higher than the slowest node. Even with only one node, its performance can be considerably slower compared to stand-alone mode.

.. container:: list-col2

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`WAN Latency <wan-latency>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 221 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      When using Galera over a WAN, links can have exceptionally high latency. Check this by measuring the Round-Trip Time among nodes, and correct it by adjusting temporal parameters.


   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`WAN Replication <wan-replication>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 161 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      When running a cluster over a WAN, there may be transient network connectivity failures. To prevent this from partitioning the cluster, try increasing the *keep-alive* timeouts.


   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Write-Set Cache Size <customizing-gcache-size>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 467 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      If you have storage issues, there are some guidelines to adjust the ``gcache.size`` parameter, properly. You could also change your state snapshot method.


   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Write-Set Caching during State Transfers <gcache-during-state-transfers>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 156 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Galera nodes don't use much more memory than a stand-alone. The certification index and uncommitted write-sets drain some. Write-set caching during state transfers is the exception.

   .. rst-class:: section-heading
   .. rubric:: Topology

.. container:: list-col1

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Single Master Setup <single-master-setup>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 81 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      It's possible to designate one node in a cluster to handle all writes, to be the *master* to the other nodes. To do this, there are certain configuratoin requirements.

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Multi-Master Setup <multi-master-setup>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 55 words; Pub: Jun 2015

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      The more *masters* in a cluster, the higher the probability of certification conflicts. This can lead to undesirable rollbacks and performance degradation.

.. container:: list-col2

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Two-Node Clusters <two-node-clusters>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 880 words; Pub: Jun 2015; Revised: Nov 2019

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      There are potential problems with two-node clusters: A split-brain situation may occur. When one node fails, the remaining node becomes non-operational.

   .. rst-class:: section-heading
   .. rubric:: Security & SQL

.. container:: list-col1

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Setting an SELinux Policy <setting-selinux-policy>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 345 words; Pub: Jun 2015; Revised: Oct 2019

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      When you first installing a node, SELinux will prohibit cluster activities. You will need a SELinux policy so it will recognize cluster activities as legitimate.


.. container:: list-col2

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Synch a Transaction First <sync-transaction-before-another>`

   .. rst-class:: list-stats

      Length: 994 words; Pub: May 2019; Revised: Nov 2019

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      When entering a transaction, you may need to ensure a previous transaction has been committed on the current node. Synchronization functions can make this easier to do.


.. _`kb-best-use-cases`:
.. container:: banner

   .. rst-class:: section-heading
   .. rubric:: Use Cases

.. container:: list-col1

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: Read Master

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Traditional MySQL master-slave topology, but with Galera all “slave” nodes are capable masters at all times, it is just the application who treats them as slaves. Galera replication can guarantee 0 slave lag for such installations and due to parallel slave applying, much better throughput for the cluster.

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: Disaster Recovery

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Disaster recovery is a sub-class of WAN replication. Here one data center is passive and only receives replication events, but does not process any client transactions. Such a remote data center will be up to date at all times and no data loss can happen. During recovery, the spare site is just nominated as primary and application can continue as normal with a minimal fail over delay.
	  
   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: Write scalability

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Distributing writes across the cluster will harness the CPU power in slave nodes for better use to process client write transactions. Due to the row based replication method, only changes made during a client transaction will be replicated and applying such a transaction in slave applier is much faster than the processing of the original transaction. Therefore the cluster can distribute the heavy client transaction processing across many master nodes and this yields in better write transaction throughput overall.

.. container:: list-col2

   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: Latency Eraser

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      With WAN replication topology, cluster nodes can be located close to cilents.Therefore all read & write operations will be super fast with the local node connection. The RTT related delay will be experienced only at commit time, and even then it can be generally accepted by end user, usually the kill-joy for end user experiences is the slow browsing response time, and read operations are as fast as they possibly can be.
	  
   .. rst-class:: rubric-2 list-sub-header
   .. rubric:: WAN Clustering

   .. rst-class:: list-abstract

      Synchronous replication works fine over the WAN network. There will be a delay, which is proportional to the network round trip time (RTT), but it only affects the commit operation.
