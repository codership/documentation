This section is the documentation for Galera Cluster. This is straightforward documentation, not tutorials or advice articles. See below for those. The documentation includes hundreds of pages of information on configuring every aspect of Galera (i.e., :doc:`Reference Manual <./documentation/reference>`), as well as information on administering a cluster (i.e., :doc:`Administration Manual <./documentation/administration>`).

Occasionally, you may have problems getting a cluster to work the way you want. Maybe you'll have a node that just won't join the cluster. Or a node or the cluster crashes. The Knowledge Base provides Troubleshooting articles explaining how to resolve common problems. It also contains Best Practices articles for improving performance, ensuring against crashes, and other methods for getting the most out of Galera.
