===================

Codership is pleased to offer a comprehensive training program related to Codership products, as well as key related software.  These products includes training courses on Galera Cluster, Galera Arbirator, and Galera Load Balancer.  Key related software includes MySQL and MariaDB database systems and tools commonly used by DBA (e.g., ``mysqldump``).  Topics include installing, configuring, monitoring, and administering all of this software, in particular as it relates to Galera Cluster.

In this Training section, you'll find information on upcoming training courses that are conducted by the staff at Codership, with some taught by the original developers of Galera Cluster.  For those who prefer a self-paced training, we have a set of training videos to help you learn about Galera Cluster and related software.
