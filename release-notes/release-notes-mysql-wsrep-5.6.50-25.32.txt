Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.6.50 and wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.6.50.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and
upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of MySQL-wsrep 5.6 for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the last binary release by Codership
(5.6.49-25.31).

- FreeBSD compatibility for Xtrabackup v2 SST script was improved
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#379).

Known issues with this release:

- If using the Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial package, the server can not be bootstrapped
  using systemd. Please use the SysV init script with the 'bootstap' option to
  bootstrap the node. Note that a server that has been started that way can not
  be controlled via systemd and must be stopped using the SysV script. Normal
  server startup and shutdown is possible via systemd.

- Server cannot be started using 'service' command on Debian Stretch.

End of Life Notice:

- This is the last official build for CentOS 6 and RedHat 6.
- As MySQL 5.6 is nearing its end of life, upgrading to MySQL-wsrep 5.7
  is highly recommended.

Reminder: Changes to Repositories Structure
===========================================

With the new release the repository structure is changed
to allow for existence of all of the wsrep-patched mysql
versions currently supported: 5.5 through 5.7.
Thus the repository layout requires from the user to
adjust his or her repository configuration to accomodate
those changes. In order to have the WSREP and Galera
library installed, one would need to add the following
repositories:
    1. Galera-3 repository for galera library:
    e.g. https://releases.galeracluster.com/galera-3/<ldist>/
    2. Corresponding mysql-wsrep repository:
    e.g. https://releases.galeracluster.com/mysql-wsrep-<mversion>/<ldist>
    here: *ldist* is Linux or BSD distribution (Ubuntu, Centos) and *mversion*
    is MySQL version, i.e. 5.6, 5.7 or 8.0

How To Install
--------------

Repositories contain dummy or meta packages, called mysql-wsrep-<mversion>
which are convenience packages for installation of the corresponding version
of WSREP. One can install the whole suite by running, for example:
`apt-get install mysql-wsrep-5.6 galera-3`

#### Quirks for Ubuntu Xenial and 5.6
Due to the peculiarities of how apt resolves packages and presence of 5.7
libraries in Xenial repositories the command above might require additional
steps/changes in order to succeed.

One would need to either configure apt pinning for codership repositories for
them to have priority over upstream packages or to specify mysql-common package
version explicitly as the one located in the WSREP repositories in order to get
things installed.
