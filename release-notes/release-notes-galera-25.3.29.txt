Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.29,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.


Notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.28):

* A bug in GCS where JOIN message was delivered even if the node
  was in DONOR state was fixed.

* An issue where GCache could contain mixed histories from different
  clusters was fixed.

* Setting socket.recv_buf_size was not effective because it was done
  after the socket was connected or accepted. Also the default value
  caused TCP receive buffer autotuning to be disabled. This lead to
  suboptimal performance in high bandwidth WAN clusters.

  The default value for socket.recv_buf_size was changed to 'auto'
  which lets the kernel to tune TCP receive buffer. A new variable
  socket.send_buf_size with default value 'auto' was added to allow
  also send buffer tuning.
  (codership/galera#552)

* GComm socket timestamping/liveness checking caused false positives
  during replication of large transactions, which caused excessive amounts
  of broken connections. (codership/galera#553)

* Large transactions were able to monopolize bandwidth when segmentation
  was configured. This caused messages which were relayed by segment
  representative to be delayed. As a fix implemented fair queuing of
  messages. (codership/galera#553)

* GComm EVS layer did excessive broadcasting to retransmit missing messages
  when packets were lost or delayed. The communication protocol was optimized
  to use point-to-point messaging to deliver missing messages and to rate
  limit retransmission requests. (codership/galera#554)

* Because of a bug in quorum computation, two primary conflicting primary
  components were formed when the group merged and partitioned again
  while the new primary view was forming.

Reminder: Changes to Repositories Structure
===========================================

With the new release the repository structure is changed
to allow for existence of all of the wsrep-patched mysql
versions currently supported: 5.5 through 5.7.
Thus the repository layout requires from the user to
adjust his or her repository configuration to accomodate
those changes. In order to have the WSREP and Galera
library installed, one would need to add the following
repositories:
    1. Galera-3 repository for galera library:
    e.g. https://releases.galeracluster.com/galera-3/<ldist>/
    2. Corresponding mysql-wsrep repository:
    e.g. https://releases.galeracluster.com/mysql-wsrep-<mversion>/<ldist>
    here: *ldist* is Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Centos, ...) and *mversion* is MySQL version, i.e.
    5.5, 5.6, 5.7

How To Install
--------------

Repositories contain dummy or meta packages, called mysql-wsrep-<mversion>
which are convenience packages for installation of the corresponding version
of WSREP. One can install the whole suite by running, for example:
`apt-get install mysql-wsrep-5.6 galera-3`

#### Quirks for Ubuntu Xenial and 5.6
Due to the peculiarities of how apt resolves packages and presence of 5.7
libraries in Xenial repositories the command above might require additional
steps/changes in order to succeed.

One would need to either configure apt pinning for codership repositories for
them to have priority over upstream packages or to specify mysql-common package
version explicitly as the one located in the WSREP repositories in order to get
things installed.
