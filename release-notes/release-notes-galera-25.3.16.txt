Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.16,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.15):

- a counter is now used to track the number of desync operations currently running 
- a new option, gcomm.thread_prio, allows specifying the priority of the gcomm thread
- a new option, ist.recv_bind can be used to listen for IST requests on a particular interface
