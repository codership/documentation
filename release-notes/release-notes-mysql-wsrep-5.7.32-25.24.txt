Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for
MySQL 5.7, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.7.32 and wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.7.32.

Galera Cluster 5.7 is now available as targeted packages and package
repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and SLES.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of MySQL-wsrep 5.7 for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable new features in MYSQL-wsrep 5.7 subce latest release 5.7.32-25.24.

- A new variable `wsrep_mode` was introduced to wsrep behavior. The
  first application of the variable is to allow ignoring native
  replication filter rules if configured with `replicate-do-db`
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#372).

Notable fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the last binary release by Codership
(5.7.32-25.24).

- Load data splitting was fixed to generate Xid events for binlog
  events also for intermediate commits (codership/mysql-wsrep#376).
- FreeBSD compatibility for Xtrabackup v2 SST script was improved
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#379).
- Due to regression in `mysqld_safe` script recovery step was skipped
  when starting MySQL server, causing full SST to be donated when
  IST should have taken place. This issue affected systems which do not
  use systemd. This has now been fixed.


End of life notice:

This is the last official build for CentOS 6 and RedHat 6.

Known issues with this release:

- Server cannot be started using 'service' command on Debian Stretch.
- SST between 5.6 and 5.7 nodes is not supported
- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
  may not be copied over during SST
- Compilation with DTrace enabled may fail, so -DENABLE_DTRACE=:BOOL=OFF
  may be given to cmake to disable DTrace

Changes to Repositories Structure
=================================

With the new release the repository structure is changed
to allow for existence of all of the wsrep-patched mysql
versions currently supported: 5.5 through 5.7.
Thus the repository layout requires from the user to
adjust his or her repository configuration to accomodate
those changes. In order to have the WSREP and Galera
library installed, one would need to add the following
repositories:
    1. Galera-3 repository for galera library:
    e.g. https://releases.galeracluster.com/galera-3/<ldist>/
    2. Corresponding mysql-wsrep repository:
    e.g. https://releases.galeracluster.com/mysql-wsrep-<mversion>/<ldist>
    here: *ldist* is Linux or BSD distribution (Ubuntu, Centos) and *mversion*
    is MySQL version, i.e. 5.6, 5.7 or 8.0

How To Install
--------------

Repositories contain dummy or meta packages, called mysql-wsrep-<mversion>
which are convenience packages for installation of the corresponding version
of WSREP. One can install the whole suite by running, for example:
`apt-get install mysql-wsrep-5.7 galera-3`
