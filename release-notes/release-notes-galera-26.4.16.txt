Changes in Galera 4.16 (2023-08-18)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.16,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a number of Linux distributions, including Debian 10 (Buster) and 11 (Bullseye), Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic), 20.04 LTS (Focal) and 22.04 LTS (Jammy), CentOS 7 and RHEL 7, 8, and 9.
