Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.21,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE, SLES and FreeBSD. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.20):

* Galera now considers umask when creating gcache files
  (GAL-505, codership/galera#449)

* Clean abort is ensured when core piping is used (GAL-505)

* Node state is marked unsafe when slave executes TOI (GAL-504)

* A bug in send monitor that could cause the node to stop replicating under
  heavy write load has been fixed. (GAL-495)

* URI parsing has been improved for IPv6 addresses
  (GAL-501, GAL-338, codership/galera#338)

* GCache recovery fixes (GAL-494, GAL-500)

* IST progress is reported in the log (GAL-491)

* Improved build time checks for ASIO version (GAL-510)

Changes to Repositories Structure
=================================

With the new release the repository structure is changed
to allow for existence of all of the wsrep-patched mysql
versions currently supported: 5.5 through 5.7.
Thus the repository layout requires from the user to
adjust his or her repository configuration to accomodate
those changes. In order to have the WSREP and Galera
library installed, one would need to add the following
repositories:
    1. Galera-3 repository for galera library:
    e.g. http://releases.galeracluster.com/galera-3/<ldist>/
    2. Corresponding mysql-wsrep repository:
    e.g. http://releases.galeracluster.com/mysql-wsrep-<mversion>/<ldist>
    here: *ldist* is Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Centos, ...) and *mversion* is MySQL version, i.e.
    5.5, 5.6, 5.7

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD is available in FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

How To Install
--------------

Repositories contain dummy or meta packages, called mysql-wsrep-<mversion>
which are convenience packages for installation of the corresponding version
of WSREP. One can install the whole suite by running, for example:
`apt-get install mysql-wsrep-5.6 galera-3`

#### Quirks for Ubuntu Xenial and 5.6
Due to the peculiarities of how apt resolves packages and presence of 5.7
libraries in Xenial repositories the command above might require additional
steps/changes in order to succeed.

One would need to either configure apt pinning for codership repositories for
them to have priority over upstream packages or to specify mysql-common package
version explicitly as the one located in the WSREP repositories in order to get
things installed.
