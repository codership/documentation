Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.13,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com,
while previous releases remain available on LaunchPad. The source repositories
and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.12):

- the 'could not find key from cert index' warning will no longer be printed in
  certain situations (codership/galera#361)
- fix compilation on the latest Debian release (codership/galera#321)
- fix compilation on FreeBSD
- several fixes to the build scripts to support various distros and
  architectures (codership/galera#321)
