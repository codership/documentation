Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.5.47 and Galera 3.14, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.5.47.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.
The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep 5.5.47:

- Limit binlog recovery so that the wsrep position found from
  storage engines is not exceeded. This is required to have consistent
  position between wsrep position stored in innodb header and
  recovered binlog (codership/mysql-wsrep#226)
