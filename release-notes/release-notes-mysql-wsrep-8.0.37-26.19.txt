# Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.37-26.19 (2024-07-01)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.37 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.37.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Debian 10 (Buster), 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
(Focal), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), CentOS 7 and RHEL 7, 8, and
9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.36-26.18:
- running GRANT with wsrep_forced_binlog_format=ROW produced an unrecoverable
binary log (binlog). Now wsrep_forced_binlog_format is only effective for DML
operations, and is also marked as deprecated because binlog_format has been
deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34 (the only possible logging format is ROW, making
this option redundant).
- Support for table names with special characters
- Binlog coordinated wsrep recovery now improved.
- Ported MDEV-29293, reorganising BF abort codepaths so that mutex locking
cycles don't happen when accessing the victim THD from BF THD. This fixes the
occasional stuck on starting commit state. 
- WSREP_SST_OPT_PORT unset variable check fixed
- the GRA log file was malformed due to missing Format_description_log_event; it
is now easier to read with mysqlbinlog
- race condition in wsrep InnoDB watchdog fixed
- fix unexpected server abort after MDL conflict between RSU and local command
- improve MDL conflict reporting by printing all lock types
- fix applying failures due to MDL deadlocks by making sure that appliers get
higher priority compared to locally executing DDLs in MDL deadlock resolving
- Improve "BF applier failed to open_and_lock_tables" warning

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.
