Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.26-26.8 (2021-11-15)

Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.26 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.26.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package
repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and RHEL.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.25-26.7:

- New wsrep_mode IGNORE_CASCADING_FK_DELETE_MISSING_ROW_ERROR was added
  to work around applying errors with cascading delete. This is a
  workaround for https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=80821.
- A rare deadlock between cluster configuration change and FLUSH TABLES
  WITH READ LOCK was fixed.
- Executing FLUSH TABLES is now allowed also when not in primary component.
- A bug which caused streaming replication transaction to roll back locally
  but not in the cluster was fixed (MDEV-26707).
- New SST configuration options donor-timeout and joiner-timeout
  were added.
- MDL BF-BF conflict between ALTER and UPDATE was fixed. A certification
  key corresponding to MDL lock taken for table referenced by foreign
  key constraint is added to write set to make parallel applying dependencies
  correct.
- Write set applying reliability was improved by introducing periodic
  check for long lock waits for applied write sets.
- Terminology change: The use of 'master' and 'slave' was deprecated.
  The following system variables were renamed:
  * wsrep_slave_threads -> wsrep_applier_threads
  * wsrep_slave_FK_checks -> wsrep_applier_FK_checks
  * wsrep_slave_UK_checks -> wsrep_applier_UK_checks
  * wsrep_restart_slave -> wsrep_restart_replica
- Packages for Debian 11/Bullseye are now provided.
- OpenSSL library version has been updated to version 1.1.1l in
  binary tarball release.

XtraBackup compatibility:

- Percona XtraBackup version 8.0.26-18.0 or higher is required to
  perform XtraBackup based SSTs.

End of life notice:

- Due to little usage pattern building MySQL-wsrep 8.0 packages
  for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 was discontinued.

The users still running above discontinued platforms are advised to
use the binary tarball package.

Known issues with this release:

- When installing software on CentOS 8, dnf modules mysql and mariadb must
  be disabled before installing Galera Cluster software. This can be done
  by running `dnf module disable mysql mariadb`.
