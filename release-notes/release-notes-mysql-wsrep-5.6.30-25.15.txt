Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.6.30 and Galera 3.16, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.6.30.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

New features and notable changes in MySQL-wsrep since last binary release by
Codership (5.6.29):
