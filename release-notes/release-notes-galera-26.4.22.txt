# Changes in Galera 4.22 (2025-02-25)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.22,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12
(Bookworm), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble),
RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to
download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera
nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.21:
- New feature for applications to define sequential consistency parameters for
the certification process, via wsrep_certify_v1() which takes an application
defined callback
- Fixed assertions in report_last_committed() that could cause issues under
certain thread scheduling conditions 
- Removed unnecessary assertions that could trigger due to normal timing
variations in distributed environments
- Fixed string format warnings that were appearing during builds on Debian Sid

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
