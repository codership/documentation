Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.19,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.18):

* A new wsrep provider option, gcache.recover, enables gcache to be recovered at
  restart. This allows the restarted node to serve IST to any other nodes that
  are also starting, which may speed up whole-cluster restarts.

* An additional protection against restarting a cluster using a node that may not
  have all the transactions has been implemented. Unless a node was the last one
  to be shut down from the previous cluster, Galera will refuse to bootstrap from
  it until explicit action is taken by the operator.

* Galera would refuse to start on PPC64EL (lp1633226, GAL-418)

* Galera would crash or enter an infinite loop in the asio library (GAL-416)

* It was not possible to set pc.wait_prim and pc.wait_prim_timeout options using
  wsrep_provider_options (GAL-360, codership/galera#360)

* For security reasons, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0 will no longer be negotiated during
  SSL handshake (codership/galera#428)
