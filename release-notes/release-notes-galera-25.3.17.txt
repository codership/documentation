Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.17,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.16):

- A receive buffer size of 208K is now used for intra-node communications. This avoids
a situation where the cluster could stall or split when using high-latency, low-bandwidth
network links. A new option, socket.recv_buf_size can be used to control the size of the buffer.

- Experimental support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial is now available.

- A node could crash if an invalid value is used for gcs.max_packet_size (codership/galera#414)

- A node could crash if the SHOW STATUS command is used (codership/galera#408)
