Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.5.61 and wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.5.61.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.
The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership.

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

* New configuration option wsrep_certification_rules to
  enable more relaxed certification rules for foreign key references
  on child table inserts. This option is effective only with Galera
  version 3.24 or higher (galera#491).

* Resource leak in case of ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT followed
  by COMMIT has been fixed (mysql-wsrep#318).

* FK constraint violation in applier after ALTER TABLE ADD FK was fixed
  by adding both parent and child table keys into ALTER TOI write set
  (mysql-wsrep#332).


Reminder: Changes to Repositories Structure
===========================================

With the new release the repository structure is changed
to allow for existence of all of the wsrep-patched mysql
versions currently supported: 5.5 through 5.7.
Thus the repository layout requires from the user to
adjust his or her repository configuration to accomodate
those changes. In order to have the WSREP and Galera
library installed, one would need to add the following
repositories:
    1. Galera-3 repository for galera library:
    e.g. http://releases.galeracluster.com/galera-3/<ldist>/
    2. Corresponding mysql-wsrep repository:
    e.g. http://releases.galeracluster.com/mysql-wsrep-<mversion>/<ldist>
    here: *ldist* is Linux or BSD distribution (Ubuntu, Centos) and *mversion* is MySQL version, i.e.
    5.5, 5.6, 5.7

How To Install
--------------

Repositories contain dummy or meta packages, called mysql-wsrep-<mversion>
which are convenience packages for installation of the corresponding version
of WSREP. One can install the whole suite by running, for example:
`apt-get install mysql-wsrep-5.6 galera-3`

#### Quirks for Ubuntu Xenial and 5.6
Due to the peculiarities of how apt resolves packages and presence of 5.7
libraries in Xenial repositories the command above might require additional
steps/changes in order to succeed.

One would need to either configure apt pinning for codership repositories for
them to have priority over upstream packages or to specify mysql-common package
version explicitly as the one located in the WSREP repositories in order to get
things installed.
