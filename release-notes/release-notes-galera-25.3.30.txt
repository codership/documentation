Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.30,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

Notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.29):

- GCache recovery was fixed to reclaim all available space in
  ring buffer.
- Error handling during frequent cluster configuration changes
  was improved.
- A segmentation fault with multicast was fixed.

Packaging:

- Support for CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 was added in this release. In order to
  install Galera package on CentOS 8 or RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules
  need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
- A binary tarball containing Galera library was added in this
  release.
