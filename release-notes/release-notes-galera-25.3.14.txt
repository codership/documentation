Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.14,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.13):

- use system ASIO library when compiling, if available (codership/galera#367)
- improvements to Debian packages that allow a Galera library package downloaded
  from galeracluster.com to be used with Percona XtraDB Cluster and MariaDB Cluster
