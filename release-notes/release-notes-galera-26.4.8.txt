Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.8,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

Notable fixes in Galera replication since last release by Codership (4.7):

- Recovery to wrong position after process was killed during IST
  was fixed (codership/galera#210).
- Support for X509 certificate chains (codership/galera#571).
- Improved SSL error messages to contain also certificate verification
  error reason.
- SSL certificates may now be reloaded by setting `socket.ssl_reload=1`
  provider option.
- Upgrade path from non-SSL to SSL cluster with `socket.dynamic=1`
  provider option. With this option enabled, the cluster will operate
  in mixed mode allowing nodes to communicate over both TCP and
  SSL connections.
- OpenSSL version in binary tarball build was bumped to 1.1.1k.

Build fixes:

- Atomic library linkage fixes for Debian platforms (codership/galera#558).
- CMake post build check fixes to use correct objdump binary
  (codership/galera#558).
- Byteswap compilation failures on FreeBSD were fixed
  (codership/galera#581).
- Hardware CRC32C support for FreeBSD/ARM.

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on CentOS 8 or RHEL 8, MySQL and
  MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable
  mysql mariadb`.
