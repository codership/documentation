Changes in Galera 3.36 (2022-02-14)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.36,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and RHEL.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD will be available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 3.35:

- Ring buffer has been enhanced to avoid segfaults if an invalid buffer leaks
past the initial recovery scan. dump_map() method implemented for ring buffer to
get more detailed debugging.
- Join messages are always sent when not in JOINER state; this relaxed condition
is required for the correct handling of the desync counter especially in the
DONOR state. This fixes MDEV-27459.
- Intermediate libraries are added as STATIC to allow cmake
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON to work correctly, fixing codership/galera#611.

End of life notices:

- We have stopped building CentOS 8 packages, and we cannot guarantee that
packages built for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 will continue working for CentOS
Stream.

The users still running above discontinued platforms are advised to use the
binary tarball package.

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
