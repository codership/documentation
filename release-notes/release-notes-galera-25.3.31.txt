Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.31,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

Notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.30):

- The in-memory GCache index implementation was reworked to use sorted
  std::deque instead of std::map, leading to eightfold reduction in
  GCache memory footprint.

- CRC32C implementation was reworked. Hardware CRC32C is now supported
  on x86_64 and ARM64 platforms.

- Bus error due to unaligned access on Sparc64 platform was fixed.

- Three new status variables were added: wsrep_flow_control_active,
  wsrep_flow_control_requested and wsrep_gmcast_segment.

- Prevent GCache rollover on Donor during IST.

- Incorrect handling of return value from SST donate callback
  was fixed (codership/galera#284).

- Binary tarball package is compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.1g.

Other changes:

- Unit tests were reworked to replace deprecated Check library
  API calls with supported ones (codership/galera#577).

Known Issues:
- In order to install Galera package on CentOS 8 or RHEL 8, MySQL and
  MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable
  mysql mariadb`.

End of Life Notice:

This is the last release for Debian Jessie and openSUSE 15.0.
