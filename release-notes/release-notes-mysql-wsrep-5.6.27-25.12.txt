Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.6.27 and Galera 3.13, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.6.27.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com,
while previous releases remain available on LaunchPad. The source repositories
and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

New features and notable changes in MySQL-wsrep since last binary release by
Codership (5.6.25):

- A "compat" package is now provided to allow MySQL-wsrep to be installed without
  removing packages such as Postfix which depend on older MySQL versions
- The MySQL-wsrep packages are now built with OpenSSL rather than YaSSL
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#121)
- Galera error messages have been enhanced to contain the current schema name
  along with the query (codership/mysql-wsrep#202)

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

- IB atomic builtins are no longer used when compiling as they may cause the server
  to hang (codership/mysql-wsrep#221)
- query cache is now compatible with wsrep_sync_wait (codership/mysql-wsrep#201)
- a deadlock could occur between the applier thread and an aborted transaction
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#184)
- a memory leak could occur when using SHOW STATUS (codership/galera#308)
- DDL was not recorded in InnoDB header, causing InnoDB to recover to an earlier
  position (codership/mysql-wsrep#31)
- an assertion could happen with Prepared Statements
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#125, codership/mysql-wsrep#126)

New features and notable changes in MySQL 5.6.26 - 5.6.27:
- security fix for the LogJam issue. The key length used for creating Diffie-Hellman
  keys has been increased to 2,048 bits.
- yaSSL was upgraded to version 2.3.8
- Miscellaneous fixes in InnoDB
