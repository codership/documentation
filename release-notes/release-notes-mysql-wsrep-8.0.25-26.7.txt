Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.25-25.7 (2021-07-26)

Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.23 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.25.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package
repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and SLES.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.23-26.6:

- Changing system variable wsrep_on value during multi statement
  transaction is not allowed (MDEV-25226).
- SST scripts for rsync and xtrabackup-v2 SST methods now accept
  ssl-ca, ssl-cert and ssl-key configuration varibles either in
  [sst] or [mysqld] configuration section. The old variables
  tca, tcert and tkey are now deprecated but still accepted if
  they are present in [sst] section in the configuration file.
- Binlog purging was disabled when the mysqld server was started with
  --wsrep-recover option (codership/mysql-wsrep#381).
- Clone SST method reliability was improved.
- Parallel applying of write sets to tables without primary key
  was disabled (MDEV-25551).
- Both MDL and InnoDB locking was improved to handle cluster-wide
  conflicts more gracefully.
- Parallel applying for FK parent delete was fixed to respect
  applying order.

XtraBackup compatibility:

- Percona XtraBackup version 8.0.25-17.0 or higher is required to
  perform XtraBackup based SSTs.

Packaging:

- A dependency to stunnel package was added as it is needed for
  rsync SST SSL support.

The packages are available from https://releases.galeracluster.com/ for
the following operating systems:

- CentOS 7 and 8
- Debian 10
- RedHat 7 and 8
- SLES 15 SP 1
- Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04

End of life notices:

- Due to little usage pattern we plan to discontinue building MySQL-wsrep 8.0
  packages for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 after this release.

The users still running above discontinued platforms are adviced to
use the binary tarball package.

Known issues with this release:

- When installing software on CentOS 8, dnf modules mysql and mariadb must
  be disabled before installing Galera Cluster software. This can be done
  by running `dnf module disable mysql mariadb`.
