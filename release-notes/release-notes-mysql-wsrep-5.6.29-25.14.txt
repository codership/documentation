consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.6.29 and Galera 3.15, wsrep API version 25.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

New features and notable changes in MySQL-wsrep since last binary release by
Codership (5.6.28):

- A new variable, wsrep_dirty_reads can be used to enable reading from a non-primary node

- A new variable, wsrep_reject_queries can be used to instruct a node to reject
  incoming queries or terminate existing connections

- Issuing FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK will cause the node to stop participating in
  flow control so that the other nodes do not become blocked (MW-252)

- The wsrep_sst_xtrabackup script has been updated from the upstream project

- A Contribution agreement was added in order to facilitate future contributions to the project

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

- If wsrep_desync is already set, running DDL under RSU could fail (MW-246)

- Wrong auto_increment values could be generated if Galera was a slave to an
  asyncronous master that is using STATEMENT replication (MW-248)

- If a prepared statement was a victim of a conflict and Galera attempted to
  rerun it, the slave could abort (MW-255)

New features and notable changes and bug fixes in MySQL 5.6.29:
