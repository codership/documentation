Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.22 and Galera 4.7, wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.22 and numerous fixes and
enhancements specific to Galera replication.

Notable new features in MySQL-wsrep 8.0 since latest release 8.0.21-26.4.

- A new SST method based on Clone plugin was added.
- A new variable `wsrep_mode` was introduced to wsrep behavior. The
  first application of the variable is to allow ignoring native
  replication filter rules if configured with `replicate-do-db`
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#372).
- Logging was improved to display the origin of wsrep-lib and Galera
  related messages. Log messages prefixed with `P` come from
  Galera library, messages prefixed with `L` come from wsrep-lib.

Notable fixes in MySQL-wsrep since latest release 8.0.21-26.4.

- Load data failure with foreign keys was fixed (codership/mysql-wsrep#375).
- PS protocol compatibility with MySQL-wsrep was improved.
- FreeBSD compatibility for Xtrabackup v2 SST script was improved
  (codership/mysql-wsrep#379).
- BF-BF conflicts between OPTIMIZE/REPAIR/ALTER TABLE and DML in
  precense of foreign key constraints were suppressed (MDEV-21577).
- Due to regression in `mysqld_safe` script recovery step was skipped
  when starting MySQL server, causing full SST to be donated when
  IST should have taken place. This issue affected systems which do not
  use systemd. This has now been fixed.

XtraBackup compatibility:

- Percona XtraBackup version 8.0.22-15.0 or higher is required to
  perform XtraBackup based SSTs.

The packages are available from https://releases.galeracluster.com/ for
the following operating systems:

- CentOS 7 and 8
- Debian 10
- RedHat 7 and 8
- SLES 15 SP 1
- Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04

Known issues with this release:

- When installing software on CentOS 8, dnf modules mysql and mariadb must
  be disabled before installing Galera Cluster software. This can be done
  by running `dnf module disable mysql mariadb`.
- When installing software in Ubuntu 20.04, in order to select
  correct versions of mysql-common and mysql-client packages, the
  following must be run before installing mysql-wsrep-8.0 package

   common_version=$(apt-cache policy mysql-common | \
                    grep Candidate | \
                    awk -F ':' '{print $2}' | \
                    tr -d ' ' | grep 8.0)
   apt-get install -y mysql-common=${common_version} mysql-client=${common_version}
