Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.18,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.17):

* After a certain pattern of server restarts, an isolated node could stop attempting
  to reconnect to the cluster (GCF-890)

* Galera would fail to compile with clang 3.8 (refs codership/galera#412)

* The wsrep_desync_count variable could show a wrong value (GAL-401)
