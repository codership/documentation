Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL 
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.5.42 and Galera 3.10, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.5.42.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories 
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, 
OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the 
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of 
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com, 
while previous releases remain available on LaunchPad. The source repositories 
and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership . 

New features and notable changes in MySQL-wsrep since last binary release by 
Codership (5.5.37):

- The wsrep_causal_reads variable has been deprecated. A new variable,
wsrep_sync_wait, has been introduced to allow causal checks to be specified
separately for selects, updates and inserts (lp:1277053)
- improved support for distributions based on the .deb package format, such as 
Ubuntu

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:
- getifaddr() rather than ifconfig is used to detect the IP of the node,
resulting in better compatibility with newer Linux distributions 
(codership/mysql-wsrep#45) . 
- Table administration commands such as CHECK TABLE are now replicated
(lp:1046726)
- Improvements in the replication of events (lp:1312618)
- SST could fail with thousands of tables (lp:1294431)
- Character unique keys could cause false certification failures (lp:1314854)
- Node aborts if it first joins a non-primary component (lp:1334606)
- Rsync SST could fail if the rsync port is already taken (lp:1099783)

New features and notable changes in MySQL 5.5.38 - 5.5.42:
- Support for SSL 2.0 and 3.0 has been disabled as they provide weak encryption;
- Security issue with ALTER TABLE ... ADD FOREIGN KEY has been fixed (Bug 
#19471516, Bug #73650)
- yaSSL was upgraded to version 2.3.7;
- TRUNCATE TABLE is logged only when it executes successfully, in order to 
prevent inconsistencies. (Bug #17942050, Bug #71070)
- Various fixes in InnoDB and native MySQL replication;


Known issues with this release:
- There is a package conflict on CentOS 6/7 which requires manual removal of 
postfix, mysql and mariadb libraries before installing mysql-wsrep
