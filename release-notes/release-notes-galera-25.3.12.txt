Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.12,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com,
while previous releases remain available on LaunchPad. The source repositories
and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.10):

- Support for Debian Jessie (codership/galera#264)
- Galera will abort gracefully if there is no disk space to write the required gcache files (codership/galera#324)
- Gcache files are removed faster than before in order to reduce Galera disk usage (codership/galera#317)
- Better error logging in case of SSL errors or misconfiguration (codership/galera#290)
- The configuration in /etc/sysconfig/garb is now properly honored by the garbd systemd service (codership/galera#267)
- Arbitrator service no longer starts automatically on package installation, giving the user the opportunity to configure it first (codership/galera#266)
- Miscellaneous fixes in the garb startup script (codership/galera#186)
