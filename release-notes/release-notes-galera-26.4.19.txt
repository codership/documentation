# Changes in Galera 4.19 (2024-07-01)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.19,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Debian 10 (Buster), 11 (Bullseye), and
12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS
(Noble), CentOS 7 and RHEL 7, 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package
repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the
deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.18:
- WSREP_KEY_SHARED key type is being phased out since it had insufficiently
strict certification rules that may lead to certification test passes where it
should fail. WSREP_KEY_REFERENCE fixes this, and all new writesets will be
constructed using this. WSREP_KEY_SHARED is supported for backwards
compatibility.
- A memory leak in the commit cut action has been fixed.
- Network level node isolation, which can help shut down all communication with
the rest of the cluster to achieve a fail-silent crash. 
- GCS level protocol bumped, as error voting for joiner in the JOINED state was
broken when group-wide commit cut (implied SUCCESS vote) was not taken into
account when processing error vote requests from the JOINED node. 

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
