# Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.34-26.15 (2023-08-18)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.34 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.34.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Debian 10 (Buster) and 11 (Bullseye), Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic), 20.04 LTS
(Focal) and 22.04 LTS (Jammy), CentOS 7 and RHEL 7, 8, and 9. Obtaining packages
using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and
facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.33-26.14:
- when the server as started with read-only=ON, the mode toggled off during
concurrent load due to a race condition. 
- condition to replay a transaction via autocommit retry is now based entirely
on wsrep_conflict_state, not accessing the lex tree as it is not guaranteed to
be in a well-formed state (not user visible, but notable as to how
wsrep_retry_autocommit now works)
- INFO-level wsrep messages are now logged with SYSTEM_LEVEL priority by
default, as WSREP information level messages are crucial for debugging
replication issues. New variable, `wsrep_info_level` introduced to allow
changing the priority to INFORMATION_LEVEL if needed.
- during CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, Galera will not support
wsrep_forced_binlog_format=MIXED|STATEMENT, and it will result in ROW with a
warning.
- Fix an inconsistency caused by ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT 
- systemd multi-instance support fixed, such that one can specify startup
position and instance to bootstrap.

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.

End of Life Notice:

- this is the last release for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) as it is has reached
EOL May 31 2023.
