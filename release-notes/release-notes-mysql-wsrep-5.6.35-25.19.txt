Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.6.35 and Galera 3.20, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.6.35.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE, SLES and FreeBSD. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and
upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.
The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

- Using Galera cluster as an asynchronous replication slave with replication filtering 
  could cause holes to form in the GTID sequence (MW-319)

- An assertion could occur if --wsrep_log_conflicts=ON is used and the server was compiled
  with assertions enabled (MW-28, codership/mysql-wsrep#28)

- If Galera had to perform transaction replaying on a particular transaction, the
  "affected rows" field in the message returned to the client could be incorrect (MW-329)

- An "OK" message could be sent to the client even if a query was aborted due to
  a transaction conflict (MW-328)

- An error about a transaction conflict could be delivered to the next client statement,
  rather than the statement it was about (MW-328)

- Compilation with GCC 6 has been fixed (MW-332)

- Running a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement could cause the cluster to hang (MW-253)

New features, notable changes and bug fixes in Oracle MySQL 5.6.35:

- Incompatible Change: The mysqld_safe script has been fortified against various security
  vulnerabilities

- INSERT operations on a table with an auto_increment key could result in a duplicate
  key error (Bug #76872)

Known issues with this release:

- If using the Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial package, the server can not be bootstrapped using systemd.
  Please use the SysV init script with the 'bootstap' option to bootstrap the node. Note that
  a server that has been started that way can not be controlled via systemd and must be stopped
  using the SysV script. Normal server startup and shutdown is possible via systemd.
