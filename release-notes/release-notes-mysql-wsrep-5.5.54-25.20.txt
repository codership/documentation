Known issues with this release:

- If using the Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial package, the server can not be bootstrapped using systemd.
  Please use the SysV init script with the 'bootstap' option to bootstrap the node. Note that
  a server that has been started that way can not be controlled via systemd and must be stopped
  using the SysV script. Normal server startup and shutdown is possible via systemd.
