Changes in Galera 4.14 (2023-03-08)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.14,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and RHEL.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD will be available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.13:

- memory leak in the gcs gcomm backend fixed (tp_ object deleted in GCommConn
destructor)
- protonet.backend option deprecated since it only supports one option, asio,
and the option will be removed in future release. Related, protonet.version is
also deprecated
- deprecation message for socket.ssl_compression as SSL compression cannot be
enabled and the option will be removed in future releases
- library could parse incorrect parameters as long as it had a "good" prefix,
i.e. evs.*, so fix prevents setting of invalid option values
- parsing of ISO8601 durations previously accepted invalid values, now fixed
- in addition to ISO8601 format, parsing durations now supports real number
representation

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
