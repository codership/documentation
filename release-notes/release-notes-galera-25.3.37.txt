Changes in Galera 3.37 (2022-05-16)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.37,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and RHEL.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD will be available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 3.36:

- WORK_DIR parameter added for garb.cnf and launch scripts to ensure Galera
Arbitrator handles recovery files better (this includes command line option to
specify working directory), fixing codership/galera#313

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
