Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.20,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE, SLES and FreeBSD. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.19):

* Galera can now be compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.0 (GAL-445, codership/galera#407)

* Included asio library would fail to compile with some compilers
  (GAL-445, codership/galera#407)

* Compilation could fail when compiling on FreeBSD (GAL-476)

* An assertion could happen with two consecutive DDLs run under RSU (GAL-480)

* A scons option, system_asio=0 is now available to prevent using the system
  asio library when compiling Galera

* Compilation could fail if attempting to compile Galera with GCC 6 (GAL-484)

* An scons option, deterministic_tests=1, is now available to
  disable non-deterministic Galera unit tests (GAL-470, codership/galera#432)
