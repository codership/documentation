Changes in Galera 4.10 (2021-11-15)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.10,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS
and RHEL. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD will be available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.9:

- Error handling during IST failures was improved.
- Provider option gcs.fc_master_slave was deprecated in favor of
  gcs.fc_single_primary.
- OpenSSL library version has been updated to version 1.1.1l in
  binary tarball release.
- Packages for Debian 11/Bullseye are now provided.

End of life notices:

- Due to little usage pattern building Galera 4 packages
  for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 was discontinued.

The users still running above discontinued platforms are advised to
use the binary tarball package.

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on CentOS 8 or RHEL 8, MySQL and
  MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable
  mysql mariadb`.
