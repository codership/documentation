Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.5.46 and Galera 3.13, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.5.46.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

while previous releases remain available on LaunchPad. The source repositories
and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .
