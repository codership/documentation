Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.14,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the
need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of
Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

New features and notable fixes in Galera replication since last binary release
by Codership (3.14):

- fixes for compiling on Alpha / HP PA / s390x architectures (codership/galera#389)
- A Contribution agreement was added in order to facilitate future contributions (codership/galera#386)
