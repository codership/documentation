Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for
MySQL 5.7, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.7.24 and wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.7.24.

Galera Cluster 5.7 is now available as targeted packages and package
repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, OpenSUSE and SLES.
Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download
individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of MySQL-wsrep 5.7 for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership.

New features in MySQL-wsrep:

* Auth_pam and auth_dialog plugins were added in this release.

* Support for Ubuntu/Bionic was added in this release.

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

* Rsync SST was not copying tablespace from the donor node (mysql-wsrep#334).

* Fixes for transaction replaying from stored procedures (mysql-wsrep#336).

* Fixed a regression where transaction replaying caused a crash when
  AUTOCOMMIT=OFF (mysql-wsrep#344).

* Fixes for transaction replaying from event scheduler (mysql-wsrep#347).

* Fixed crash in write set applying with
  binlog_rows_query_log_events option enabled (mysql-wsrep#343).

* Maximum variable value length was increased in order to avoid truncation
  of long wsrep_provider_options variable string (mysql-wsrep#348).

Known issues with this release:

* Server cannot be started using 'service' command on Debian Stretch.

* SST between 5.6 and 5.7 nodes is not supported

* The --wsrep-replication-bundle option has no effect and may be removed in
  a future release

* InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
  may not be copied over during SST

* Compilation with DTrace enabled may fail, so -DENABLE_DTRACE=:BOOL=OFF
  may be given to cmake to disable DTrace

Changes to Repositories Structure
=================================

With the new release the repository structure is changed
to allow for existence of all of the wsrep-patched mysql
versions currently supported: 5.5 through 5.7.
Thus the repository layout requires from the user to
adjust his or her repository configuration to accomodate
those changes. In order to have the WSREP and Galera
library installed, one would need to add the following
repositories:
    1. Galera-3 repository for galera library:
    e.g. http://releases.galeracluster.com/galera-3/<ldist>/
    2. Corresponding mysql-wsrep repository:
    e.g. http://releases.galeracluster.com/mysql-wsrep-<mversion>/<ldist>
    here: *ldist* is Linux or BSD distribution (Ubuntu, Centos) and *mversion* is MySQL version, i.e.
    5.5, 5.6, 5.7

How To Install
--------------

Repositories contain dummy or meta packages, called mysql-wsrep-<mversion>
which are convenience packages for installation of the corresponding version
of WSREP. One can install the whole suite by running, for example:
`apt-get install mysql-wsrep-5.6 galera-3`

#### Quirks for Ubuntu Xenial and 5.6
Due to the peculiarities of how apt resolves packages and presence of 5.7
libraries in Xenial repositories the command above might require additional
steps/changes in order to succeed.

One would need to either configure apt pinning for codership repositories for
them to have priority over upstream packages or to specify mysql-common package
version explicitly as the one located in the WSREP repositories in order to get
things installed.
