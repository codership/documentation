# Changes in MySQL-wsrep 5.7.43-25.35 (2023-08-18)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
5.7, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.7.43 and wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.7.43.

Galera Cluster 5.7 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic), CentOS 7 and RHEL 7 and 8. Obtaining packages
using a package
repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the
deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of MySQL-wsrep 5.7 for FreeBSD will be available in the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

** WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND AN UPGRADE TO MySQL 8.0 AS MySQL 5.7 HAS END-OF-LIFE
OCTOBER 2023. ** 

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 5.7.42-25.34:

- a fix from 8.0 was backported, that when the server as started with
read-only=ON, the mode toggled off during concurrent load due to a race
condition. 
- condition to replay a transaction via autocommit retry is now based entirely
on wsrep_conflict_state, not accessing the lex tree as it is not guaranteed to
be in a well-formed state (not user visible, but notable as to how
wsrep_retry_autocommit now works)

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.
- this is the last release for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) as it is has reached
EOL May 31 2023.
