# Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.41-26.22 (2025-02-25)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.41 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.41.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal), 22.04 LTS
(Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a
package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates
the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.40-26.21:
- Fixed issue with GRANT/REVOKE role statements not replicating across nodes
(codership/mysql-wsrep#421)
- Improved error handling in wsrep_sync_wait() by moving error handling to the
end of dispatch_command()
- Fixed transaction handling with BF aborts during COMMIT statements
(MDEV-35446)

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.
