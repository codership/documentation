Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.31-26.12 (2023-03-08)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.31 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.31.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and RHEL. Obtaining packages using a package
repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the
deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of MySQL-wsrep 8.0 for FreeBSD will be available in the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.30-26.11:

- mysqladmin now displays all status variables for wsrep, overriding the default
upper limit to be read from the server
- a wsrep_diag.sql script contains useful diagnostics queries for
troubleshooting wsrep related issues
- wsrep_recover script accepts now --basedir and --mysqld options to support
  installations in non-standard locations (codership/mysql-wsrep#409)
- better handling of Total Order Isolation, from mistakenly skipped replication
to error reporting
- mysqld_bootstrap script handles interruptions 
- now have version_comment variable to display server version releases
- the wsrep position can be recovered even if wsrep is off
- new wsrep_mode APPLIER_IGNORE_MISSING_TABLE which enables the server to skip
failures with table open at applying time, but only if the log event contains
other tables that are open. This is the default setting now, improving
multi-table updates involving triggers

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.
