Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.30-26.11 (2022-11-24)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.30 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.30.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and RHEL. Obtaining packages using a package
repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the
deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of MySQL-wsrep 8.0 for FreeBSD will be available in the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.28-26.10:

- OpenSSL 3.0 compatibility exists
- Audit log character set information asset fix, since the default character set
changed from `utf8` to `utf8mb3`
- New keyring_vault plugin for encryption
- CLONE SST cleanup when joiner is killed does not reserve the listen port any
longer
- DDL XIDs now use the wsrep seqno
- innodb-wsrep-applier-lock-wait-timeout made read-write
- Deprecated wsrep_slave_UK_checks variable with the default set to ON.
- Roles are replicated (CREATE ROLE/DROP ROLE)
- Variable innodb_wsrep_applier_lock_wait_timeout is now dynamic

We have one word of **warning** to all users upgrading from a previous version
that happen to use INSTANT ALTER. Users can check whether INSTANT ALTER is used
by running:

	SELECT NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES WHERE TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS >
0;

If tables with row versions are found, it is recommended to run OPTIMIZE TABLE
for those tables before upgrading to 8.0.30. 

Please refer to our release blog for more information.

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.
