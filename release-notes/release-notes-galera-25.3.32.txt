Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 3.32,
implementing wsrep API version 25.

The library is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL and SLES. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment
and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The latest version of Galera for FreeBSD is available in the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.

Notable fixes in Galera since latest release 3.31.

- CRC32 hardware support compatibility was improved on ARM based architectures
  (codership/galera#579, codership/galera#582).
- A race condition in GCache locking was fixed.

Other changes:

- Build system was changed from SCons to CMake. SCons scripts are still
  available, but will not be actively maintained.

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on CentOS 8 or RHEL 8, MySQL and
  MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable
  mysql mariadb`.

End of Life Notice:

- This will be the last official build for CentOS 6 and RedHat 6
  which have reached end of life.
